1. Overview

   
LLM-Language-Games is a test suite of nine Language-Games used in the Master research project
"LLMs and Language-Games" at the Department of Computer and Systems Science, Stockholm University.
The research question was "What types of Language-Games pose the greatest challenge
for LLMs in terms of rule adherence?"

3. Project Description


The Large Language Models used in the test suite were GPT-4, Claude Opus, Cohere R+ and Gemini Pro.
Language-Games is a concept used by language philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein to explain the pragmatic
view that context determines the meaning of words and sentences.

By use of game-theoretical distinctions three "axes" are used to divide Langage-Games;
competition v/s cooperation, same v/s different roles, and static v/s dynamic information. 
Eight games were developed and a ninth game "bad rules" was added as a control, to check
if we could confirm the result from earlier studies that the prompt formulation
impact the results the most.

3. Result


Our analysis showed that games with dynamic information pose the greatest challenge for LLMs.

5. How to Install and Run the Project


The application is built on Farama Foundations ChatArena. It has nine games and the research result.
You can add your API string to play the games (in the code) and toggle the players.

7. How to Use the Project


We would love to have additional testing and analysis!
